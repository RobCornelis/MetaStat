# MetaStat
Metastat is a proof of concept to explore automated metadata creation for (confidential) CBS Statline datasets. 
This is done through a largely automated script, with limited user input and without the need for the user to access the data directly or open the file. 

The goal is to created a automated but versatile script, which can be ran on any different dataset from Statline.
