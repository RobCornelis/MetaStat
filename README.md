# MetaStat
Metastat is a proof of concept to explore automated metadata creation for (confidential) CBS Statline datasets. 
This is done through a largely automated script, with limited user input and without the need for the user to access the data directly or open the file. 

The goal is to create an automated but versatile script, which can be ran on any different dataset from Statline.

In it's current state, the code will return:
- A user defined amount of associated themes per column.
  - Themes are defined within a thesaurus given by the user (Standard is CESSDA ELSST Thesaurus).
  - Association is calculated through embedding (Standard by use of all-MiniLM)
- Description
  - Generated by GROQ LLM based on the dataset column headers
- Title (based on user input)
- URL (based on user input)
- Various Metadata:
  - column_names
  - column_count
  - row_count
  - value_type
  - missing_values_count
  - value_range (if numeric)
  - column_means
  - column_medians
  - column_sd

Future work:
- Move the LLM description generation further down the pipeline.
  - By moving the LLM description generation after the embedding- and association calculation process, the LLM will be able to generate a description that is more connected to the user's wishes, as it will by proxy make use of the thesaurus specified by the user.
- Make the embedder context aware.
  - In it's current state, the embedding model loops over the individual column headers, only returning the association of a specific header instead of taking into account the embedding of the additional headers in the dataset. We aim to implement this.
